  GDG Belarus is a chapter of the Google Developer Group program. We provide
  tools and opportunities to learn new technologies and be connected to the
  local community, improving the local ecosystem and the quality of local
  talent. When you join a Google Developer Group, youâ€™ll have the opportunity to
  meet local developers with similar interests in technology. A GDG meetup event
  includes talks on a wide range of technical topics where you can learn new
  skills through hands-on workshops. The community prides itself on being an
  inclusive environment where everyone and anyone interested in tech -from
  beginner developers to experienced professionals - all are welcome to join.
